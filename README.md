# BISS - STILL IN WORK
# Use on your own risk - It's not really tested yet.

TODO: Replace all set XX in an array list (if possible)
TODO: Replace all sed with mapfile and substitution
TODO: We could also replace grep with mapfile and bash rematch (Note: The performance can be bad as hell by doing this)
TODO: Implement Stacktrace based on DEBUG - https://github.com/yoctu/yosh/blob/master/lib/cli.sh#L60
TODO: Implement verbose with set -v or event set -x

# NOTE: I have copied the most part of the existing code
# and just reimplemented the basic stuff in bash without challenging all.
# The challenge part will be the next step

It's kiss but in bash

NOTE: Shellcheck will be applied in the end of the project.
